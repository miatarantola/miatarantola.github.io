<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This blog post will contain two parts. The first portion will be completed prior to our talk and will be based on self guided research on our speaker Timnit Gebru. I will take notes and pose some thoughtful questions that I think will make for a good discussion.</p>
<p>The second portion will be completed during/after Gebru’s talk. I will take notes and reflect on the material.</p>
<p><strong>Dr.&nbsp;Timnit Gebru is a successful American computer scientist who focuses on artificial intelligence and algorithmic bias. She has become a well known advocated for diversity in technology and even founded her own community , Black in AI. In December 2020 Gebru left her position as the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team lead at Google, following pushback fron her as-yet unpuclished paper voicing her concerns on the dangerous biases of large language models.</strong></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notes-of-dr.-grebrus-talk-conference-on-computer-vision-and-pattern-recognition-2020">Notes of Dr.&nbsp;Grebru’s talk: conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2020</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sBE5OyD7fk&amp;t=802s">recording of the talk</a></p>
<p>Timnit Gebru’s talk on “Computer Vision in practice: who is benefitting and who is being harmed?” focuses on the ethical ramifications of computer vision technology in our society. Grebru emphasizes the need for critical thought on the possible effects of new technologies on marginalized communities as a top researcher in artifical intelligence and ethics.</p>
<p>Gebru’s talk emphasizes the danger that can result from the use of computer vision technology when it is implemented without adequate consideration of the potential consequences. She discusses how face recognition technology may be used to mistakenly identify people based on their gender and skin color, potentially leading to false charges and arrests. Additionally, predictive policing systems that rely on biased data sets can perpetuate systemic discrimination against communities of color, leading to increased surveillance and targeting. The ethics of data collecting and utilization are also covered by Gebru. She emphasizes that a model’s deployment might still be unethical even if its accuracy is identical among all groups. Images scraped from numerous online sources are frequently included in data sets, often without the subjects’ knowledge. She says that people are unlikely to want their pictures to be used in face recognition software to identify protesters.</p>
<p>Gebru argues that it is essential for individuals who create and use computer vision systems to take into account these possible negative effects and strive toward creating more open and accountable business processes. She stresses the importance of diversity and inclusion in the creation of moral and responsible AI systems. She also encourages businesses and decision-makers to give underrepresented populations’ demands and worries first priority while developing and implementing computer vision technologies.</p>
<p>Gebru’s presentation serves as a reminder of the essential part AI practitioners and researchers must play in influencing the creation and use of computer vision technologies. We can progress toward developing AI systems that are beneficial to every member of society by considering the ethical implications of these systems and including a variety of viewpoints into their development.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR In order to create ethical and just predictive modeling systems, we need to prioritize the need for diverse and inclusive development and implementation practices.</strong></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-2">Part 2</h2>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Gebru’s talk focused on aritificial intelligence, specifically artificial general intellengence (AGI) and its relateion to eugnics. AGI is an aritficial intellegence algorithm or software that can outperform a smart, well-educated human. She was able to shed light on some of the idealogies that drive the AGI movement forward. She, and some collaborators have coined the term TESCREAL to desribe some of these motivations.</p>
<p>The “T” stands for transhumanism, which is the belief that people should evolve as a species by merging biological and synthetic technology to enhance themselves. More specifically, there would be two different species of the human race. The first: post-human - humans who are smarter, more intelligent and thus would be allowed to reproduce more. The second: legacy humans - those who are deemed “lesser than or defective” and would not get to reproduce.</p>
<p>The E stands for extropianism which argues that human can reverse or alter entropy to have an extended or everlasting life.</p>
<p>The S stands for singularitianism which is the belief that technology will continue to evolve and eventually design itself, leading to a technology explosion.</p>
<p>The C standing for cosmism - the idea that humans will merge with technology and the development sentient AI and mind uploading technology.</p>
<p>The EA refers to effective altruism which is the belief to do the most good.</p>
<p>Longtermism is a philosopy that prioritizes the maximization of future intelligences. These ideas all strive for a utopia but a utopia for who?</p>
<p>ChatGPT provides an AI chatbot full of information, but at the expense of who? There have been stories of CHATGPT employees who moderate the algorithms responses and have been traumatized by the experience. Some have even developed PTSD.</p>
<p>She also touched on the dangers of AGI. One aspect was the dangers of data collection and image scraping. She illuded to the fact that many images are scraped from the internet without consent and used for controversial applications (protester identificaton). She also described that this would reinforce racial accesibily disparities. Once AI is good enough –&gt; Poor people get AI doctors: rich people get real life in person doctors.</p>
<p>Reflecting back on this talk, I am definitely happy that I attended. While I might not agree with her whole argument, there are parts that I support. I do agree that internet data scraping has become a larger issue. A significant amount of data is scraped everyday and while people choose to put their information on the internet, they often aren’t aware of all possible applications. The example of the protester identifcant is one specific example of this. Had people known their photos were being used for this application, some would probably object.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-3">Part 3</h2>
<p>I learned alot during Dr.&nbsp;Gebru’s talk. Before this experience, I had never heard of the term AGI, only AI. I was not aware that AGI had a specific name or what its purpose was. I had also never thought about relating AI and/or computer science to the eugenics. It was interesting to hear Dr.&nbsp;Gebru’s take on this topic as well. Although, I wished that she had touched on the connection from AI to AGI to eugenics a little bit more. I was having trouble following along as to how AGI was reinforcing eugenics. When I think of eugenics i was thing WWII - gene manipulation but it seems like a bit of a stretch to correlate AGI to that. But, with that being said I definitely learned something. even if I don’t agree 100% it aided in my understand of current issues in the AI field. I will also think about this talk moving forward; specifically, what the greater impact of an algorithm might be or the potential dangers/biases of AI.</p>
<p>The part of the discussion I enjoyed most was our conversation about imposter syndrome. I like how Dr.&nbsp;Gebru called it as it is; not imposter syndrome, but racism, sexism, etc. That was very empowering to me</p>
